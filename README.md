# pure-platform

A port of [reflex-platform](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-platform/) for convenient pure development. This is a work-in-progress.

Big thanks to the people at [reflex-frp](https://github.com/reflex-frp) for the great work they've done on their reflex-platform.

## Getting Started

Once you have [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) installed, it should be as simple as:

```bash
./try-pure
```

It can take a while to build - especially the first time. 

## Example

TODO: Add a simple starter Main.hs example.

# pure-platform

A port of [reflex-platform](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-platform/) for convenient pure development. This is a work-in-progress.

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Big thanks to [reflex-frp](https://github.com/reflex-frp) and [Obsidian Systems](https://github.com/obsidiansystems) for the great work they've done on their [reflex-platform](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-platform). This is simply a largely untouched port of that work for pure. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Getting Started

```bash
./try-pure
```

It can take a while to build, especially the first time.
